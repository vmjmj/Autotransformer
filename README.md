# Autotransformer
The project contains all the neccesary information to reproduce the results of the paper "Short-circuit Impedance Calculation of 25 MVA Autotransformer with Tertiary Winding using FEM".
The Project runs on AltairFlux, a commercial finite element software to solve electromagnetic problems.
The project contains all the neccesary configuration to obtain the short-circuit impedances in a power autotransformer with tertiary winding.
