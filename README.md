# Autotransformer
The project contains all the neccesary information of an autotransformer 2D finite element model.
The Project runs on AltairFlux, a commercial finite element software to solve electromagnetic problems.
The project contains all the neccesary configuration to obtain the short-circuit impedances in a power autotransformer with tertiary winding.
